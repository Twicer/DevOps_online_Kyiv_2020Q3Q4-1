Firstly I cloned repo to my workstation and made repository structure.
https://github.com/remaieva/DevOps_online_Kyiv_2020Q3Q4/tree/master/m1/task1.2/images/im1.PNG

Then made my first commit to this repo and created the new branch.

I have learned how to create branches and switching between them.

After that I tried to merge images and styles to develop branch.
There was a merge conflict in styles branch. I have to learned how to resolve merge conflicts.
Hopefully it was successfully.

And the last step was to merge develop to master branch and push it to the remote repo.
